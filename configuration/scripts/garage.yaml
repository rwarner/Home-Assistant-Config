#### Garage Door ####

# Solution / workaround for alexa triggering garage door
# Shared to the Alexa app, then setup a custom "routine" for each script
# one for "Alexa, close garage door" which triggers close_garage_door "scene"
# the other for "Alexa, open garage door" which trigger open_garage_door
# "scene". This check here makes it so either one can't do the other if the
# intention is one or the other.
